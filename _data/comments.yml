Next week, I will whip up a frenzy of interest (fingers crossed) at Mens Health magazine, perhaps some other mags, East Coast Radio, Morning Live TV, Highway Mail, Independent Newspapers about your site and your story and Phakamisa, hopefully when close to civilisation e.g. Durban!!!! reporters will start driving to you, especially for Phakas. Any other media I left out? Love Calxxxx"
