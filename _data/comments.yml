As I hiked along the beach in December and in the Drakensberg over the last 5 days, I so often thought of you two doing this hike and told so many people about it. It is wonderful that there are caring people out there like you who love nature, people, life in general and really LIVE. God's creation is reflected in you."

I just think it is amazing that you will make this walk.  I must remember that January and February is not snowy in South Africa, like it is here for us :)"
