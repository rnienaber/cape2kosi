    <h2>Diary (map based)</h2>


    <p>The hikers have been sending through their GPS coordinates every evening and each desination is shown by a marker on the map.</p>

    <div style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #cccccc;">
        <p>Red marker shows where they ended each day.</p>
        <p>Blue marker shows the rest days. (While they are the same spot at the previous day, they’ve been moved slightly so they don’t overlap.)</p>
        <p>Green marker shows where they started and finished!</p>
    </div>
    <br/>

    <p>Click on any marker to see more details about that day and to find a link to the diary for that day.</p>
