            <p> <br/>While it would be a challenge enough to do the hike, we have decided to hike to raise awareness for the PHAKAMISA ministry, which exists to serve and uplift impoverished communities through the provision of educational training, resourcing and support.</p>
            <p>Based at the Pinetown Methodist Church, the team of Phakamisa contribute to a genuine sustainable development project. Empowering people by creating a belief in themselves, and in their own abilities. </p>

        <blockquote><p>
            <strong>Alan says:</strong></p>
            <p>PHAKAMISA has been a ministry or project of Pinetown Methodist Church since the days of Rev Ray Light in the late 1980’s.I joined Pinetown Methodist in 1992 and watched this ministry grow into the enormous operation it is now.</p>
            <p>It was first called EDUCARE. My friend, Glenda Howieson, has been leading this project for many years. She is so passionate about its success that it has done just that. It is succeeding in making a difference to thousands of poverty stricken youngsters in the Durban and Pinetown area.</p>
            <p>PHAKAMISA is not a handout project – although they do give food and clothing etc. out when this is needed. They concentrate on enabling people to run pre-schools, sew, do beadwork, do carpentry, cook nutritious meals, plant food gardens etc. Glenda and her team work day and night to ensure success.</p>
            <p>I have been inspired by the project so am keen to support it. </p>
