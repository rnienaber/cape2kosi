        <h2>The Hikers - Alan and Chummy</h2>

        <p>Alan and Chummy have been toying with this idea of hiking along the beach from Cape Point to Kosi Bay for a few years now. Right from the time of being scouts together it had always been a dream of theirs.</p>
        <p>Between life and work commitments, it looked like it would never happen, until a few years ago when Alan started making noises about getting this epic walk underway.</p>
        <p>A number of planning sessions and emails passed between them (along with one huge planning spreadsheet!) and now they are off hiking the beautiful South African coastline.</p>
