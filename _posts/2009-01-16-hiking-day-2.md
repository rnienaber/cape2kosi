Mainly along tar roads. 20 km exactly. Slap chips for lunch. Swim at Glencairn and Muizenberg. Alan has blisters on both feet, and i got pinched on foot by crab when i was swimming. Nearly left our costumes and towels at Muizenberg.

*Ed: The hikers covered another good distance of 20km’s today. The weather is still excellent and they stopped at every opportunity to swim. Today’s hike also included a detour to visit the penguins at Boulder’s Beach.*
