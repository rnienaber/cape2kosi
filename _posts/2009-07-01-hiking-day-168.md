Lovely walk, high tide but quite firm to walk on. Warm sun and ever so slight breeze.

*Family and friends went to meet the hikers as they came closer to Kosi Bay. They had a long picnic afternoon on the beach and sat around the fire last night hearing story after story of the hike.*

*To all of you who have followed them on their adventure and left encouraging comments on the site, thank you for getting involved. The guys have enjoyed getting the notes you have left and they keep saying that one of the most special things has been the people they have met on the way.*

*There are still many photos to be uploaded. Chummy says certain stretches were as good as a photo every 700m. They will keep getting uploaded as they arrive so check back here to see their amazing photos. We’ll also send out one final newsletter once they are all available on the site.*

“How precious are your thoughts to me o Lord. How vast is the sum of them. Were I to count them, they would be more than the grains of sand.”
